Complex problems with ambiguous data, ethical considerations, or requiring human intuition may challenge ML. Additionally, substantial training data and potential biases can affect outcomes. Human expertise remains essential for nuanced, creative, and contextually rich challenges that extend beyond algorithmic capabilities."
